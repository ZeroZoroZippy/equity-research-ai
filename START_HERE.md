## Troubleshooting:

### "Address already in use" error?
Port 5001 is in use. Either:
1. Kill the process using port 5001
2. Or change the port in `app_demo.py` to 5002 (and update `frontend/vite.config.js` too)

### Frontend won't start?
Make sure you ran `npm install` in the frontend directory first:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Can't see the UI?
Check both terminals are still running and visit `http://localhost:3000` (not 5001)
